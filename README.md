# Political Clicker

> A clicker-style browser game about voting, money, and ruthless exploitation of the electorate.

## How do I play?

You can find a playable version of the game at this repo's Github Page. 
Just load the page and start clicking.

## How can I contribute to the project?

Making changes is fairly simple. The project uses the node packet manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)).
Once you've got that installed and the code pulled down to your local machine, just navigate 
into the `political-clicker` folder, type `npm install`, and wait until it finishes.

Once that's done, you can type `npm start` to activate the development environment from 
this folder at any time. It will automagically create a development server for you at 
http://localhost:3000 and update the code there whenever it detects a change. What's more, 
it will *also* run a linter on your code as you make changes, which will display in both 
your terminal window as well as in your browser's development console.

Make your changes, test them, commit them, make a Pull Request, and wait for me to get 
around to reviewing it. Congratulations, you're a contributor, now!

Alternatively, you could always fork the repository and do whatever you want without 
needing any approval from me at all.

## How did you make this?

This project was bootstrapped with Facebook's [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 
tool, which sets up a project and its dependencies with a single command.

The rest, I built myself.
